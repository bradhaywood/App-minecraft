NAME
    App::minecraft - Backup and restore your Minecraft. Install mods.

USAGE
    $ minecraft.pl backup
    $ minecraft.pl install Shelf.zip
    $ minecraft.pl install --jar /usr/local/bin/jar Shelf.zip
    $ minecraft.pl restore --verbose

DESCRIPTION
    As it stands this script is very limited. However, I did manage to
    successfully backup my Minecraft folder, install the Shelf mod in the
    sample directory and restore my Minecraft without any problems. Remember
    to always perform a backup using the 'backup' parameter before
    installing any mod, because this script can, and probably will, corrupt
    your main jar file. So use it at your own peril!

    In the future I'd like it to properly check the contents of each zip
    before doing anything. Some mods have different formats, and
    App::minecraft needs to be smart enough to handle those and know what to
    do with them.
